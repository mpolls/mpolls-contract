# ✅ Massa Polls - Now Upgradeable!

## What's New

Your Massa Polls contract is now **upgradeable** with full admin control and version management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Deploy the Upgradeable Contract

```bash
cd mpolls-contract
npm run deploy-upgradeable
```

This deploys version 1.0.0 with:
- ✅ Admin control (you as admin)
- ✅ Version tracking
- ✅ Emergency pause capability
- ✅ Project support
- ✅ All existing features

### Upgrade in the Future

When you need to add features or fix bugs:

```bash
# 1. Edit the contract
vim assembly/contracts/main.ts

# 2. Deploy upgrade
npm run upgrade

# 3. Update frontend
cd ../mpolls-dapp
# Update .env with new contract address from upgrade output
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Admin Functions (Only You)

```bash
npm run pause              # Emergency stop
npm run unpause            # Resume operations
npm run contract-info      # View current state
npm run manage transfer-admin <address>
npm run manage set-version "1.1.0"
```

### Pause Protection

When contract is paused:
- ❌ No new polls can be created
- ❌ No voting allowed
- ❌ No projects can be created
- ✅ All data remains readable
- ✅ Only admin can unpause

### Version Tracking

- Auto-increments on each upgrade
- Visible to users via `getVersion()`
- Tracked in `upgrade-history.json`

## 📊 How Upgrades Work

```
Old Contract (v1.0.0)          New Contract (v1.1.0)
├─ Address: ABC123...          ├─ Address: XYZ789...
├─ Status: Active              ├─ Status: Active
├─ Data: Polls 1-100          ├─ Data: Fresh start
└─ Can be paused              └─ Enhanced features

                 ↓
        Frontend switches to new address
```

**Important:** Each upgrade creates a new contract. Old data stays on the previous address (immutable).

## 🔄 Upgrade Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Fresh Start

- Each upgrade is a new contract with new features
- Old polls remain on old contract (read-only)
- Users create new polls on new contract
- Simple and clean

### Alternative: Dual Contract

- Frontend reads from both old and new contracts
- Display historical polls (old contract)
- New polls go to new contract
- More complex but preserves full history
