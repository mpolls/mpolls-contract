# 🎉 Your Contract is Now Upgradeable!

## TL;DR

```bash
# Deploy new upgradeable contract
npm run deploy-upgradeable

# Future upgrades (when you add features)
npm run upgrade

# Emergency controls
npm run pause      # Stop everything
npm run unpause    # Resume
```

## What Changed?

### ✅ Added Features

1. **Admin Control**
   - You're automatically the admin
   - Transfer admin rights anytime
   - Admin-only functions for critical ops

2. **Version Management**
   - Tracks contract version (starts at 1.0.0)
   - Auto-increments on upgrades
   - View with `npm run contract-info`

3. **Emergency Pause**
   - Stop all poll creation and voting
   - Data remains readable
   - Resume when safe

4. **Upgrade Path**
   - Deploy new versions easily
   - Old data preserved on old contract
   - Automatic version tracking

### 🔧 New Admin Functions

```typescript
// In the contract:
pause()              // Admin only
unpause()            // Admin only
transferAdmin()      // Admin only
setVersion()         // Admin only
getAdmin()           // Anyone can view
getVersion()         // Anyone can view
isPaused()           // Anyone can check
```

### 🛡️ Safety Features

- Critical functions check pause state
- Only admin can pause/unpause
- Version tracking for transparency
- Admin transfer for flexibility

## 🚀 Deployment

### First Time (Upgradeable)

```bash
cd mpolls-contract

# Build and deploy
npm run deploy-upgradeable
```

**Output:**
```
✅ CONTRACT DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY!
📍 Contract Address: AS1abc...xyz
🔗 Explorer: https://buildnet-explorer.massa.net/address/AS1abc...xyz
💾 Deployment info saved to: deployment.json
📝 .env file updated
```

**What happens:**
1. Contract deployed to Buildnet
2. You're set as admin
3. Version set to 1.0.0
4. Address saved to `deployment.json` and `.env`
5. Contract funded with 0.1 MASSA

### Update Frontend

```bash
cd ../mpolls-dapp

# Copy contract address from deployment output
echo "VITE_POLLS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=AS1abc...xyz" > .env

# Test
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Upgrading

### When to Upgrade

- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs
- Improving functionality
- Security patches

### How to Upgrade

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
vim assembly/contracts/main.ts

# 2. Run upgrade (builds + deploys)
npm run upgrade
```

**Upgrade Process:**
```
Old Contract v1.0.0        New Contract v1.1.0
├─ ABC123...xyz            ├─ XYZ789...abc
├─ Has: 50 polls          ├─ Fresh start
├─ Status: Can pause      ├─ New features
└─ Data: Preserved        └─ Updated code
```

### After Upgrade

1. **Update Frontend** - Use new contract address
2. **Test** - Verify all functions work
3. **Announce** - Tell users about new version
4. **Monitor** - Watch for issues

## 📊 Upgrade Tracking

The system tracks all upgrades automatically:

**deployment.json** (current deployment)
```json
{
  "address": "AS1xyz...",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "deployedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "previousVersions": ["AS1abc..."]
}
```

**upgrade-history.json** (full history)
```json
[
  {
    "from": "AS1abc...",
    "to": "AS1xyz...",
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

## 🎛️ Management Commands

### View Contract Status

```bash
npm run contract-info
```

Shows:
- Contract address
- Admin address
- Current version
- Pause status

### Emergency Pause

```bash
# Stop all operations
npm run pause

# Resume later
npm run unpause
```

When paused:
- ❌ Can't create polls
- ❌ Can't vote
- ❌ Can't create projects
- ✅ Can read data
- ✅ Admin can manage

### Transfer Admin

```bash
npm run manage transfer-admin AU12abc...xyz
```

### Update Version String

```bash
npm run manage set-version "2.0.0"
```

## 🔐 Security

### Who Can Do What?

**Anyone:**
- Create polls (when not paused)
- Vote on polls (when not paused)
- Create projects (when not paused)
- View all data (always)
- Check pause status (always)

**Poll Creator:**
- Update their poll
- Close their poll

**Project Creator:**
- Update their project
- Delete empty project

**Admin (You):**
- Everything above +
- Pause/unpause contract
- Transfer admin rights
- Set version number

### Best Practices

1. ✅ Keep admin private key secure
2. ✅ Test on testnet before mainnet
3. ✅ Announce upgrades to users
4. ✅ Backup deployment files
5. ✅ Monitor after upgrades

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Admin not set" error
- Deploy with `npm run deploy-upgradeable`
- Older deployments don't have admin

### "Contract is paused"
- Run `npm run unpause` as admin
- Or deploy new contract

### Lost admin access?
- If you lost private key, deploy new contract
- Old contract becomes immutable
- Data preserved but no admin functions

### Upgrade not working?
1. Check you're admin: `npm run contract-info`
2. Ensure .env has correct wallet keys
3. Try: `npm run build && npm run upgrade`

## 🎯 What's Next?

1. ✅ Deploy upgradeable contract
2. ✅ Test basic features
3. ✅ Update frontend
4. ✅ Create some polls
5. ✅ Try pause/unpause
6. ✅ Make a code change
7. ✅ Test upgrade process

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Future-proof** - Add features anytime
- **Safe** - Emergency pause if needed
- **Transparent** - Version tracking
- **Flexible** - Transfer admin if needed
- **Controlled** - You have full control
