## 🎯 Upgrade Strategy

We use a **Redeployment Strategy** (not Ethereum-style proxy):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Old Contract v1.0.0               │
│  Address: AS1abc...                │
│  Status: Can be paused             │
│  Data: 50 polls, 5 projects        │
│  Admin: You                        │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓ Upgrade
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  New Contract v1.1.0               │
│  Address: AS1xyz...                │
│  Status: Active, new features      │
│  Data: Fresh start                 │
│  Admin: Auto-transferred           │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple and secure
- ✅ No proxy complexity
- ✅ Clean slate for each version
- ✅ Old data preserved immutably
- ✅ No data migration risks

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ New contract address each upgrade
- ⚠️ Frontend needs to update address
- ⚠️ Old data stays on old contract
- ✅ Can read from both if needed

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Contract Under Attack

```bash
# 1. Immediately pause
npm run pause

# 2. Investigate the issue
npm run contract-info

# 3. Deploy fixed version
npm run upgrade

# 4. Update frontend
cd ../mpolls-dapp
# Update .env with new address

# 5. Announce to users
```

### Admin Key Compromised

```bash
# 1. Pause immediately
npm run pause

# 2. Deploy new contract (you become admin)
npm run deploy-upgradeable

# 3. Attacker can't unpause old contract (you still admin)
# 4. Update frontend to new contract
```

## 💡 Best Practices

1. ✅ **Always test on testnet first**
2. ✅ **Backup `.env` and `deployment.json`**
3. ✅ **Announce upgrades to users**
4. ✅ **Monitor contract after deployment**
5. ✅ **Keep admin private key secure**
6. ✅ **Document what changed in each version**
7. ✅ **Test pause/unpause before going live**
8. ✅ **Verify you can call admin functions**

## 🎓 Understanding the Upgrade

### What Happens During Upgrade

1. **Build** - Contract compiled to WASM
2. **Deploy** - New contract deployed to blockchain
3. **Version** - Auto-incremented (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
4. **History** - Saved to `upgrade-history.json`
5. **Address** - New address saved to `deployment.json`
6. **Frontend** - Needs manual update to new address

### What's Preserved

- ✅ You remain admin
- ✅ Old data accessible on old contract
- ✅ Version history tracked

### What's New

- ✅ New contract address
- ✅ Updated code/features
- ✅ Fresh storage (no old polls)
- ✅ Incremented version
